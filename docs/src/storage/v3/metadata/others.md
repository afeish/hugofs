# Others

There are still some other metadata fields that are not covered in this document. They are:

1. Create or remove a VirtualVolume or PhysicalVolume
2. Bind or unbind a physical from a virtual volume
3. HeartBeat
4. ...

The interface mentioned above is not very, very important to the first version,
but it is still valued to be implemented well.
Due to the time limit, I will document them later.
