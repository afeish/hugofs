To implement the fsync method for a FUSE (Filesystem in Userspace) interface in a MVCC-based distributed file system using Go, the following steps can be taken:

Define the FUSE fsync method that takes a file path, a flag, and a response object as input parameters. The method will be called when a user-space program requests to synchronize the file contents with the storage device.
```go
func (fs *MyFS) Fsync(path string, datasync bool, intr fs.Intr) fuse.Error {
// implementation here
}
```

Retrieve the current version of the file based on the file path using the metadata service.
```go
currentVersion, err := metadata.GetCurrentVersion(path)
if err != nil {
    return fuse.ENOENT
}
```
Synchronize the data blocks with the storage device based on the flag.
```go
if datasync {
    err = dataService.SyncDataBlocks(currentVersion)
} else {
    err = dataService.SyncAllDataBlocks(currentVersion)
}
if err != nil {
    return fuse.EIO
}
```
Update the metadata of the file system to create a new version of the file.
```go
newVersion := metadata.NewVersion()
err = metadata.CreateNewVersion(path, newVersion)
if err != nil {
    return fuse.EIO
}
```
Return nil to indicate that the synchronization was successful.
```go
return nil
```
In this implementation, the fsync method retrieves the current version of the file based on the file path and synchronizes the data blocks with the storage device based on the flag. It then updates the metadata of the file system to create a new version of the file and returns nil to indicate that the synchronization was successful.

Note that this is just an example implementation, and additional error checking and handling may be necessary to ensure the correct behavior of the file system.
