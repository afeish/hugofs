To implement the flush method for a FUSE (Filesystem in Userspace) interface in a MVCC-based distributed file system using Go, the following steps can be taken:

Define the FUSE flush method that takes a file path, a file descriptor, and a response object as input parameters. The method will be called when a user-space program requests to flush the file contents to the storage device.
```go
func (fs *MyFS) Flush(path string, fh *os.File, intr fs.Intr) fuse.Error {
// implementation here
}
```
Retrieve the current version of the file based on the file path using the metadata service.
```go
currentVersion, err := metadata.GetCurrentVersion(path)
if err != nil {
    return fuse.ENOENT
}
```
Synchronize the data blocks with the storage device.
```go
err = dataService.SyncAllDataBlocks(currentVersion)
if err != nil {
    return fuse.EIO
}
```
Update the metadata of the file system to create a new version of the file.
```go
newVersion := metadata.NewVersion()
err = metadata.CreateNewVersion(path, newVersion)
if err != nil {
    return fuse.EIO
}
```
Return nil to indicate that the flush was successful.
```go
return nil
```
In this implementation, the flush method retrieves the current version of the file based on the file path and synchronizes the data blocks with the storage device. It then updates the metadata of the file system to create a new version of the file and returns nil to indicate that the flush was successful.

Note that this is just an example implementation, and additional error checking and handling may be necessary to ensure the correct behavior of the file system.
