MVCC (Multi-Version Concurrency Control) is a technique used to provide transactional consistency in a distributed file
system.
In an MVCC-based distributed file system, each write operation creates a new version of the data,
and multiple versions of the same data can exist at the same time.
Each version has a unique timestamp that identifies its creation time.
When a read operation is performed, the version with the latest timestamp is returned.

To implement MVCC in a distributed file system using a key-value (KV) store to support metadata, the following design
and organization can be used:

1. Each file and directory in the file system is represented by a unique key in the KV store. The key can be generated
   using a hash function on the file path.

2. Each key has a value that contains the metadata associated with the file or directory.
   The metadata contains attributes such as the file type, file size, creation time, modification time, and access time.

3. To support MVCC, each key can have multiple values, with each value representing a different version of the metadata
   associated with the file or directory. Each version has a unique timestamp that identifies its creation time.

4. To support efficient retrieval of the latest version of the metadata for a file or directory, an index can be
   maintained
   that maps each file or directory key to the latest version timestamp.

5. When a write operation is performed on a file or directory, a new version of the metadata is created with a new
   timestamp. The new version is added to the KV store, and the index for the file or directory key is updated to point
   to the latest version timestamp.

6. When a read operation is performed on a file or directory, the index is used to retrieve the latest version timestamp
   for the file or directory key. The metadata for the latest version is then retrieved from the KV store.

7. To support consistency in the MVCC-based distributed file system, a distributed locking mechanism can be used to
   prevent concurrent updates to the same file or directory key.

With this design and organization, a MVCC-based distributed file system can provide transactional consistency by using
multiple versions of the metadata and selecting the latest version for each read operation. The KV store provides a
scalable and reliable storage mechanism for the metadata, while the index and distributed locking mechanism ensure
efficient retrieval and consistency of the metadata.
