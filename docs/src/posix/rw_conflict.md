In POSIX, if one client is writing a file while another client is reading from the same file, the behavior depends on
several factors, including the type of file descriptor used by the reading client and the specific system call being
used for the write operation.

If the writing client is using a regular file descriptor (obtained from the open() system call), and the write operation
does not modify the portion of the file that the reading client has already read, then the reading client will continue
to read the original data from the file. This is because the reading client has a copy of the data in its buffer, and
the write operation does not affect these data.

However, if the write operation modifies the portion of the file that the reading client has already read, the behavior
is undefined and can lead to data corruption or loss. The data that the reading client has already read may be
inconsistent with the updated data in the file.

If the writing client is using a file descriptor with the O_APPEND flag set (obtained from the open() system call), then
the write operation will always append the data to the end of the file, regardless of the current file offset. This
means that the reading client will not see the updated data until it reaches the end of the file.

If the writing client is using a file descriptor with the O_DIRECT flag set (obtained from the open() system call), then
the write operation bypasses the file system cache and writes directly to the disk. This can potentially cause the
reading client to see stale data from the file system cache, since the updated data may not be immediately visible.

Therefore, it is important for applications to properly handle concurrent access to files, and to ensure that writing 
operations do not modify data that are being read by other clients. Additionally, file locking mechanisms can be used to
prevent concurrent access to the same file, and to ensure that data consistency is maintained.
